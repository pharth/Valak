# Future Scope

We have an exciting roadmap that includes several significant enhancements. These include the implementation of a store system, allowing for NFT transactions and the creation of a robust marketplace. We're also planning to introduce a multiplayer mode, providing opportunities for cooperative gameplay and social interaction. Non-player characters (NPCs) are on the horizon, adding depth to our game's narrative and quests.

# Challenges We Faced

Our journey was marked by significant challenges, foremost among them being the steep learning curve of Unity, the incorporation of Web3 technology, and the integration of various SDKs into our project. Notably, none of our team members had prior blockchain experience, which added complexity to our task. These hurdles, coupled with the demand for seamless collaboration and communication, put our adaptability and problem-solving skills to the test. Regrettably, due to the constraints of a strict timeline, we couldn't fully realize all our marketplace ideas as initially envisioned.
